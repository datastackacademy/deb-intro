    "As a programmer and data engineer, you will often encounter unexpected behavior from your code, and will need to be able to diagnose the problem and find a solution. That process, of finding and resolving errors (bugs) in your program, is called *debugging*. Debugging is part art and part science - sometimes correcting program errors can be surprisingly difficult. We will only discuss the basics of Python debugging here, but if you are interested to learn more, see the additional links at the bottom of this document. \n",

We can check our variables as we go, using `p` as before, allowing us to know the exact state of our code before the line that generates the error.
