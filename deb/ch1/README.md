# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Python and Pandas

Although you have all had an intensive introduction to Python, some of the basic concepts are so important that it is worth reviewing them again here. The first half of Chapter 1 focuses on essential Python concepts, with some extra practice to reinforce those skills.

The second part of this chapter focuses on Pandas, a Python library written for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas is indispensible when working with data, and is one of the most essential tools in use today by data engineers, data scientists, data analysts, and others. This chapter introduces Pandas concepts and tools which we will make frequent use of in later lessons.
