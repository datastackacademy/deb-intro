    "This brings us to the Python concept of *iterators*. All the collection types (list, dict, set, tuple) we've been working with are iterators, as is the `str` (string) type. *iterators* are python objects capable of returning their members one at a time, permitting them to be iterated over in a for loop. This means that iterators have built in `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods (we will learn more about creating these whe we discuss Python classes). In addition to the collection objects, we've also used the iterator `range()` when making lists of numbers. One aspect of iterators that `range()` helps illustrate is that they can be lazily evaluated. What this means is that the iterator does not have to store all the values to be iterated on; instead it can store the logic for creating that logic and all the values are enumerated once iteration is invoked."
