- ## Ch. 5: Docker

    In chapter five, you will learn to work with containerization using Docker. Containers have become standard practice in software and data engineering, because they allow us to package our code along with dependencies so that it is easily portable between platforms.

    - Ep. 1: Basic Docker CLI & Dockerfile
    - Ep. 2: Advanced Dockerfile
    - Ep. 3: Docker-compose

    - Ep. 2: Automate with Airflow
    - Ep. 3: Airflow Advanced Topics
    - Ep. 4: Buffer
    - Ep. 5: Cloud Composer
    - Ep. 6: Assessment

- ## Ch. 7: Spark

    Chapter 7, another two-week chapter, will teach you how to use Apache Spark, an open-source, distributed processing system for big data workloads.  

    In the first week, we introduce Spark, its data structures, and using SQL with Spark.
