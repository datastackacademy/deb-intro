## The Data Engineering Hub

Welcome to the intro repository for Data Engineering Bootcamp! The full bootcamp curriculum contains seventeen chapters, taught over seventeen weeks. This public preview is limited to the Getting Started Guide and first two chapters of material.

Learn more about the course at [datastack.academy](https://www.datastack.academy/)!


## Getting Started

First, take a look at the [daily setup instructions](./getting-started/daily_setup.md) in the Getting Started Guide to set up your development environment. If you're on Windows, please also follow the instructions in the [Windows setup guide](./getting-started/window-setup.md), so you can follow along with the Unix bash terminal lessons.

This information will have you install all the necessary software to start this course.

> If you prefer, it's possible to skip the setup and follow along with most of the material by running notebooks in [Google Colaboratory online](https://colab.research.google.com/), instead of in your local code editor.
