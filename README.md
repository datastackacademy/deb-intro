# Data Engineering Bootcamp at Data Stack Academy

Welcome to the public preview repository for Data Engineering Bootcamp. This repository contains introductory material and the full 10-chapter curriculum for the 17-week data engineering course, along with the datasets and code examples that we will be using to teach you how to build data pipelines.

If you are new to the course and need to get oriented, take a look at the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/) first. See the [Course Overview](course-overview.md) to get a high-level view of the curriculum material and schedule.

The day-to-day instruction for the course will follow this repository material very closely. Please take at least a few minutes to [explore the /deb/ folder](/deb/) and begin to get acquainted with the structure of the course. This public preview is limited to the Getting Started Guide and first two chapters of material.
