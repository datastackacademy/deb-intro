## Getting Started

First, take a look at the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/)  to set up your development environment.

This information will have you install all the necessary software to start this course.



## Overview

The course material is divided into 10 chapters:
1. [Introduction to Python and Pandas](deb/ch1/)
1. [Working with Databases](deb/ch2/)
1. Tura-Air (aircraft and flight data)
1. Working with APIs
1. Docker
1. Google Cloud Airflow
1. Spark
1. Serverless architecture
1. Streaming (Pub/Sub + Spark)
1. Data Visualization

Each chapter is contained in its own folder, which contains an overview, episode links, and code and data resources. Click on the chapter titles above to explore the chapter structure of the course. 

There are ten chapters of material, each divided into daily episodes. Most of the chapters are covered in a week, but some of the bigger topics get two weeks per chapter. There are daily exercises in the form of challenge questions that ask you to do programming tasks with the skills from that day's material. Every week finishes with a graded project which ties together all of the week's material and builds on skills learned earlier in the course.
