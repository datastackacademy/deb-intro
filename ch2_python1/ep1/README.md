# Advanced Python Functions, Further Practice

For a reminder of steps to set up your environment for today, reference the [daily setup guide](https://github.com/datastackacademy/data-engineering-bootcamp/blob/daily_setup_guide/getting-started/daily_setup.md).

Today, we'll be learning some more advanced tools for writing Python functions, like lambda functions, recursion, callback functions, and functions with keyword arguments or varying numbers of arguments. We'll also learn to write functions that are clearer and more professional-looking, using docstrings and type hinting.

Work through the lesson notebooks in the `notebooks` folder. If you finish early, do the exercises in the `more_practice.ipynb` notebook to keep honing your Python skills.
