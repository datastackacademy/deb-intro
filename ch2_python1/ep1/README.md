# Advanced Python Functions, Further Practice


Today, we'll be learning some more advanced tools for writing Python functions, like lambda functions, recursion, callback functions, and functions with keyword arguments or varying numbers of arguments. We'll also learn to write functions that are clearer and more professional-looking, using docstrings and type hinting.

As usual, you'll find all the lessons and practice in the `notebooks` folder.
