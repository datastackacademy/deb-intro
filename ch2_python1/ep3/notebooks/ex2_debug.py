# example 2: this code block is broken! 
# Uncomment the breakpoint, then get the type of the 'my_number' variable to find out why

my_number = input("Please input a number: ")
# breakpoint()

if my_number > 5:
    print(f"{my_number} is greater than 5")
else:
    print(f"{my_number} is not greater than 5")
