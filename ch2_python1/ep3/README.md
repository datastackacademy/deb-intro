# Errors, Dates and Times, and Imports

For a reminder of steps to set up your environment for today, reference the [daily setup guide](https://github.com/datastackacademy/data-engineering-bootcamp/blob/daily_setup_guide/getting-started/daily_setup.md).
 
 This episode gives you a chance for additional Python practice by introducing three new topics: date and time data, debugging, and imports.

We've already learned several important, built-in Python data types, like dictionaries, lists, and tuples. Today, we'll be looking at a data type you'll encounter a lot in your data engineering career, `datetime`. Since it's not built-in, it has to be imported as a module (more on modules and imports later in this lesson). The datetime module supplies classes for working with dates and times. Notebook `01-dates_and_times.ipynb` will give you more practice.

Debugging is an essential skill for programmers and, if you get great at it, is like a superpower. Somebody who's good at debugging is a valuable asset to any team, so head to notebook `02-debugging.ipynb` to learn best practices. The Python files `ex_debug.py`, `ex2_debug.py`, and `ex3_debug.py` have some demo code to work with.

Imports allow you to easily use outside code in your own programs. We've already seen this, when we imported the `random` module in previous lessons. The notebook `03-imports.ipynb` has more details.
