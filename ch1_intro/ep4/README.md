# Git and GitHub
## ...and More Python Practice

In the first part of today's lesson, we'll be practicing Git and GitHub. These are essential tools for version control, collaboration, and presenting your work. You'll use Git and GitHub for your weekly code reviews and your team projects, as well as in the rest of your data engineering career. Work through the `git-crash-course.md` file to get started.

After that, we'll be getting more practice with the core Python concepts you've been learning this week. In the `notebooks` directory you'll find several notebooks with drills and challenges. Practice makes perfect, so have at it!
