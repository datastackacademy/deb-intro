# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Python

Just like a musician has to practice scales or a basketball player has to practice layups, a great data engineer has to get really good at the basics. This week of the course focuses on essential Python concepts, with some extra practice to reinforce those skills. We've mixed repetition with challenge questions, so you have a solid foundation.

 We'll also get familiar with some other essential tools, like Git, GitHub, and the command line. Open episode 1, and let's get started!
