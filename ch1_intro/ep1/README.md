# Welcome

Welcome to the very first episode of **Data Engineering bootcamp**! You know what they say...the first step is always the hardest. Not completely true... We've done everything to make this first lesson as engaging as possible. So let's get right to it ðŸ˜‰

## Why Python

You might be wondering why Python has become so dominant in the realm of working with data. Python has a number of important and useful features that make it the language of choice for data engineers, scientists, and analysts:

- Code quality - the focus on readability means that Python code is also very readable and maintainable.
- Developer productivity - Python developers are often significantly more productive than with other languages. Python code is typically one-fifth to one-third the size of equivalent Java or C++.
- Code portability - Python is supported by all major operating systems, and porting code between them is usually as simple as just copying code from one machine to another.
- Library support - Python boasts a large collection of built-in functionality (its *standard library*). When more functionality is needed, Python can be extended with user-created libraries, or with a huge collection of third-party support software.
- Component integration - Python is easy to integrate with other application components. It is written in C, can invoke C and C++ libraries, and can be called from C and C++ programs. It also supports integration with many other languages and frameworks.

Python was designed with the goal of having a simple syntax that is less cluttered than other languages, and to be fun to use. The combination of the above features with the focus on an enjoyable developer experience have made Python ubiquitous, particularly for users who are working with large amounts of data.

# Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks (or notebooks) is a tool for developing and exploring Python code and data. It's a browser based tool that allows you to develop and run python code interactively. Jupyter provides code blocks, markdown blocks, and graph/visualization capabilities. 

You can execute python code blocks, run bash terminal blocks, explain your thoughts with markdown blocks, and visualize the results in graphs.

This is extremely powerful and makes developing and sharing code very easy. Notebooks (for short) are shared amongst _data engineers_ and _data scientists_ all the time! It fact it's often the data engineer job to review an exploratory (or development) notebook designed by a data scientist and _productionalize_ it. We'll get to this later; but productionalizing a code means making it run on a larger, secure, and reliable production-ready environment; working on real data versus development samples.

After all that setup, you're finally ready to get to the fun part: Python. In the `notebooks` folder of this repository, you'll find `01-python_intro.ipynb`, which you can open using Colab. It has instructions, examples, and exercises for you to work through.
